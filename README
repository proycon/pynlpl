Description: 

PyNLPl, pronounced as "pineapple", is a Python library for Natural Language Processing. It contains various modules useful for common, and less common, NLP tasks. PyNLPl can be used for example the computation of n-grams, frequency lists and distributions, language models. There are also more complex data types, such as Priority Queues, and search algorithms, such as Beam Search.

The library is divided into several packages and modules. It is designed for Python 2.6, but aiming to be backwards compatible with Python 2.5 as well.
